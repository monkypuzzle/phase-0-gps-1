**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I wasn't sure when exactly it was necessary to be working in branches as opposed to the master branch. I think I've got a handle of that now.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
Well I got some clarification on the branches issue. And of course it was good to get some hands-on experience with a merge conflict. Originally I'd thought that merge conflicts were only relevant to pull requests, but obviously they will happen locally as well.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I asked questions about the aforementioned things, then a few other things as well. Helen used the command "less" which I'd never seen before, so it was good to learn what that was. I also asked about git commit messages - why they're written in the present tense - and about what to include in the comments and title of pull requests. Helin provided some information about how all this works in a workplace context, and that was really helpful.

**What still confuses you about Git?**
There is still plenty about Git that confuses me, because there are all kinds of commands I don't know about! Git fetch was new to me, so I'll need to do some practicing with that. 

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
It was great! Helen was bunches of fun to pair with, and I think we had a good rapport. It was clear she'd done plenty of studying and she clarified a few points for me, which was really valuable. Helin as a guide was also really great - she mostly just observed but stepped in every time we had some kind of question we couldn't answer. Having someone there who knew how these concepts are applied in the real world provided an invaluable perspective.
