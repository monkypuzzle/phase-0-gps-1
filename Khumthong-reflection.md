**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
* Is it best practice to create feature branches based from the master branch?
* How can you undo changes in Git? When and how do you use `git reset`, `git revert`, and `git rebase`?
* What exactly does `git merge` do in terms of joining two separate commit histories into one?

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
* The workflow for pull requests, reviews/approvals, and merges when collaborating on GitHub.
* The best channel to check for pull requests: email.
* How does collaboration using Git and GitHub work in commercial software development?
* The usefulness of the `history` in terminal.
* How to think about amending a merge conflict file in such a way that feels less intimidating: create the version you would ultimately like saved by the merge.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
* What is the best practice for titles and comments in pull requests?
* What is the best practice for commit messages? Why is the present tense preferred?
* Can you change to a directory outside the repo without it affecting your working tree?
* Is it necessary or common practice to always delete branches after they have been merged with the master?
    
**What still confuses you about Git?**
* Aside from the add/commit/push workflow, it's still difficult to understand exactly what the different commands and their options do. 
* I think it's a case of practice and familiarity to reduce hestitation in inadvertently executing unintended actions.
    
**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
* It was a pleasure working with Paul. In many ways he set the model for an enjoyable and helpful pairing session. He was naturally collaborative, personable, interested, willing to ask and answer questions, and fulfilled his role well both as driver and navigator. As driver, he explained the steps he was taking, and worked at a comfortable pace for both parties. As navigator, he explained the task clearly, and was very helpful in kindly pointing out errors. In essense, he always respected working as partners. I felt involved whether as driver or navigator. I'd be happy to work with Paul again.
* Helin was very informative as a guide. She was quick with useful links, and clear in her answers. My only wish was that we could have spent more time talking to her. She always engaged our curiosity. She gave valuable insight to the use of Git in a professional environment, and the reasons behind the different functionaliities we encountered (e.g. use cases for code change approvals versus simply merging on GitHub ). She provided answers and perspectives that we could not have gotten on our own, simply reading or researching on the internet.
